# Code of Conduct

- **Weekly Scheduled Meeting:** Tuesday, 12:00 - 16:00 and Wednesday 14:00 - 16:00.

- **Branch Naming:** When creating a new branch, name it according to the task you are working on, e.g., `feature/2a`.

- **Project Organization:**
  - Organize your project work into issues (tickets) on GitHub.
  - Describe each issue following the guidelines presented in class. Issues should describe the tasks presented in the `README_PROJECT.md` files.
  - Add additional issues for any tasks you identify that are necessary to complete your project work.
  - Label your issues according to their type (e.g., new feature, enhancement, bug).

- **Commit Practices:**
  - Record your work in multiple small commits rather than one big one per task, as suggested by Mark Seeman in the reading material.
  - Register all co-authors that contributed to a commit. Each co-author should be listed on a separate line in the commit message (see feedback in lecture notes).

- **Branch Management:**
  - Make all commits in short-lived feature branches, which should be merged with `main` at least once per day.

- **Project Board Usage:**
  - Use a GitHub project board to organize your work and make your work status visible.
  - Utilize the "Team planning" project template, using the board layout (not the table or project layout).
  - Add all existing issues to the project board, either manually or automatically.
  - Ensure the status of the issues is properly reflected on the project board (e.g., move work-in-progress issues to the respective column).

- **Collaboration:**
  - If you have an idea that falls under someone else's responsibility, seek their permission to work on it or pitch the idea to them so they can implement it themselves.
